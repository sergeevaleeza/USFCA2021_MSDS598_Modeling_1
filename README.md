Graduate Level Class

January - March 2022

This is combination of my school work on Data Modeling 1 class (MSDS 598 from USFCA) that I've taken during Spring 2022 semester.

This hands-on course offers an applied, practical introduction to statistical modeling with data. Students use open-source software to explore, implement and interpret statistical models to gain insights from data.
